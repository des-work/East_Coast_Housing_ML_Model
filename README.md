# US Weather & Housing Prices Predictive Modeling

## Overview:

This project aims to uncover insights into the relationship between weather conditions and housing prices in the United States. Leveraging datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedshahriarsakib/usa-real-estate-dataset/data) and the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api), we employ machine learning techniques to predict and understand the impact of weather on real estate values.

## Key Features:

- **Data Sources:**
  - [USA Real Estate Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedshahriarsakib/usa-real-estate-dataset/data): CSV format, covering real estate details across the USA.
  - [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api): Providing temperature, humidity, and precipitation data.

## Project Workflow:

### 1. Data Collection:

- Download the USA Real Estate Data from Kaggle.
- Obtain weather data from the OpenWeather API.
- Ensure data compatibility in CSV format.

### 2. Data Exploration and Cleaning:

- Explore datasets for structure, variables, and relationships.
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Ensure data consistency and integrity.

### 3. Data Integration:

- Merge real estate and weather data using common identifiers (e.g., location or date).
- Verify the integrated dataset provides a comprehensive view.

### 4. Feature Engineering:

- Create new features or modify existing ones for more meaningful insights.
- Normalize numerical features for algorithms sensitive to scale.

### 5. Machine Learning Tasks:

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
  - Identify critical factors influencing housing prices.
- **Clustering:**
  - Group real estate by zip code, enabling regional insights.
- **Prediction Model:**
  - Build a model predicting future housing prices based on weather conditions.

### 6. Regression Models:

- Utilize various regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor

### 7. Cross-Validation:

- Assess model performance using k-fold cross-validation (k=5).
- Evaluate models using negative mean squared error (MSE) as the metric.

### 8. Tableau Visualization:

- Create a Tableau project to visualize relationships between weather factors, housing prices, and geographical locations.

### 9. Documentation:

- Provide comprehensive documentation to guide users through the project, data sources, and implementation steps.
- Include instructions for SQL database integration.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Follow data collection and preparation steps outlined in the README.
   - Execute machine learning tasks and visualize results using Tableau.

3. **Explore Questions:**
   - Investigate the provided questions and draw insights from the analysis.

4. **Further Assistance:**
   - Reach out for further assistance or clarification.

## Tableau Visualization:

- Utilize Tableau to create a visual representation of the relationships uncovered in the data.
- Explore the heat map depicting weather factors, housing prices, and geographical locations.

## Additional Considerations:

- **Data Updates:**
  - Implement a strategy for regularly updating data in the SQL database.
- **Indexes and Optimization:**
  - Consider adding indexes to columns used for merging data to optimize query performance.
- **Database Security:**
  - Keep database connection credentials secure, especially for deployment.

By following these steps, users can explore the intricate relationships between weather conditions and housing prices in the US.
